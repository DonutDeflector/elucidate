### 1. Methods of Cracking Passwords
Elucidate uses 4 methods to crack passwords:
  1. Dictionary of Common Passwords
      Elucidate will use the "password.txt" file to guess the password. It contains safe-for-work (and school) from a book called       *Perfect Passwords: Selection, Protection, Authenication* by Mark Burnett (__ISBN-10: 1597490415__). 
  2. Combination of Dictionary of Common Passwords
